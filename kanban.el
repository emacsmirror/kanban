;;; Commentary:

;; If you have not installed this from a package such as those on
;; Marmalade or MELPA, then save kanban.el to a directory in your
;; load-path and add
;;
;; (require 'kanban)
;;
;; to your Emacs start-up files.
;;
;; Usage: 
;;
;; * Zero state Kanban: Directly displaying org-mode todo states as kanban board
;;
;; Use the functions kanban-headers and kanban-zero in TBLFM lines to
;; get your org-mode todo states as kanban table. Update with C-c C-c
;; on the TBLFM line.
;; 
;; Example:
;; 
;; |   |   |   |
;; |---+---+---|
;; |   |   |   |
;; |   |   |   |
;; #+TBLFM: @1='(kanban-headers $#)::@2$1..@>$>='(kanban-zero $# @# "TAG" '(list-of-files))
;; "TAG" and the list of files are optional
;; 
;; * Stateful Kanban: Use org-mode to retrieve tasks, but track their state in the Kanban board
;;
;; |   |   |   |
;; |---+---+---|
;; |   |   |   |
;; |   |   |   |
;; #+TBLFM: @1='(kanban-headers $#)::@2$1..@>$1='(kanban-todo @# @2$2..@>$> "TAG" '(list-of-files))
;; "TAG" and the list of files are optional
;;
;; TODO: The links donâ€™t yet work for tagged entries. Fix that. There
;; has to be some org-mode function to retrieve the plain header.
;; 
;; TODO: kanban-todo sometimes inserts no tasks at all if there are multiple tasks in non-standard states.
;; 
;;; Code:

;; Get the defined todo-states from the current org-mode document.
